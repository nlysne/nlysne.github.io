                <p1> Long time no update! <br><br> Sadly 'Alma Updates' disappeared as the pandemic waxxed on, so we know it's been a while since we've reached out. We're eager to share some news and some photos in the hopes that they bring a bit of cheer this holiday season! The biggest news this year of course being ...

                <p1>... the birth of little baby Eda! <br><br> We welcomed her into our family healthy (and remarkably calm) at the beginning of the year. We've found it incredible how much of an individual she seems to be even at such a young age. While Alma was giggly and playful, Eda seems to be at peace just roving (now walking*) about at her own pace exploring and generally vibing.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1" style="color: whitesmoke;">1</a></sup> She has been at the same childcare as her older sister, and is apparently well known for her "sprout"ing hair. </p1>

                    Alma has not slowed down at all! <br><br> She's in Pre-K now,<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2" style="color: whitesmoke;">2</a></sup> and is almost as enamored with drawing and play make-believe as a paratrooper as she is with <em>Frozen</em>.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3" style="color: whitesmoke;">3</a></sup> Regularly helping out with baking, she's also started her training as a sous-chef through cutting various vegetables and assembling salads. Alma has been growing in all sorts of ways, and has taken her role as big sister very seriously. Careful on the slopes around Boulder -- Alma has started tearing them up on her snowboard!

                    <br>
                    Still in Boulder, mostly sliding into a new dynamic with the new addition to the family. Nathan is still working as a postdoc at NIST, and Inara has been doing software development remotely for a startup for more than year now. <br><br> Trying to get out more than we have the previous couple of years, including a few trips to see family and friends with the kids in tow. We've been incredibly fortunate to have had so much family come out to visit as well and have been very grateful for the chance to spend more time together in 2023.
